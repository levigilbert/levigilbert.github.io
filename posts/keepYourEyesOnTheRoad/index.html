            <p>This post is somewhere between a game and game design. It
            started as satire, not sure where it’s ended up. Eventually
            I’ll make a version 2 that is more of a typical ttrpg.</p>

            <p>It’s an obscure time that could be anywhere between 1970
            and now. That’s not important. What’s important is cars and
            family.</p>
            <p>This game is intended for a crew that’s played a couple
            ttrpgs before, if not then your mileage may vary. You can
            use dice if you want, d6’s are fun, but use whatever. You at
            least need to know that the Fast and Furious franchise
            exists.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Characters drive the game. Play is structured into
            sequences, which tell the story of family. This is the end
            goal, all roads lead to family.</p>
            <section id="whats-a-sequence" class="level3">
            <h3>What’s a Sequence?</h3>
            <p>This section is based around the ideas from Paul Gulin’s
            book: “Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach”.</p>
            <p>According to Paul Gulin:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“A typical two-hour film is composed of sequences—eight-
            to fifteen-minute segments that have their own internal
            structure—in effect, shorter films built inside the larger
            film.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He also explains that:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“The difference between a sequence and a stand-alone
            fifteen-minute film is that the conflicts and issues raised
            in a sequence are only partially resolved within the
            sequence, and when they are resolved, the resolution often
            opens up new issues, which in turn become the subject of
            subsequent sequences.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you are still confused then maybe The White Stripes
            can explain it better than I can:</p>
            <figure>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSvGOKH5zxk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>
            </figure>
            <p>This is a similar concept to Dreaming Dragonslayer’s
            posts on scenes (<a
            href="https://dreamingdragonslayer.com/2021/09/27/scene-based-adventure-principles/">linked
            here</a>).</p>
            <p>So you have a sequence. Conflicts and issues are raised
            in the sequence. They’re only partially resolved and their
            resolution often opens up new issues which are addressed in
            future sequences.</p>

            <section id="how-do-i-make-a-sequence" class="level3">
            <h3>How do I make a Sequence?</h3>
            <p>Here are some tips:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>What’s the sequence about?</li>
            <li>What’s it really about?</li>
            <li>Sequence length = how much you care x number of
            characters in the scene</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ultimately the goal of each sequence in a screenplay is
            to engage the audience. In the case of a ttrpg, we want to
            engage the players. Paul Gulin gives us some tools to do so
            (starting from weakest to strongest):</p>
            <p><strong>Telegraphing</strong>: This is where you
            explicitly tell the audience what would happen in the
            future. This could be saying where you’re headed next,
            getting into a car or plane, etc. Related to this is the
            idea of a ticking clock or a deadline. You can also do what
            he calls “False Telegraphing”, when what you telegraph
            doesn’t happen. A twist.</p>
            <p>Pretty standard “how stories work”, ticking clocks and
            deadlines are interesting though and are a good way to
            create some tension/pressure.</p>
            <p><strong>Dangling Cause</strong>: Cause and effect, but
            you let the effect dangle for a while.</p>
            <p>Choices having consequences, but the consequences aren’t
            seen right away. You’re creating anticipation.</p>
            <p><strong>Dramatic Irony</strong>: Omniscient narration,
            when you know more than the characters.</p>
            <p>In ttrpgs this might be considered meta-gaming. Sometimes
            this can lead to powerful moments when you know it’s a bad
            idea to do something, but you do it anyway because that’s
            what your character would do.</p>
            <p><strong>Dramatic Tension</strong>: Somebody wants
            something badly and is having a hard time getting it. Also
            someone trying to escape something, but having a hard time
            doing so.</p>
            <p>This is the juice. It’s the gasoline that makes the car
            go. Have your characters want something badly and make sure
            they have a hard time getting it.</p>
            <p>This sounds an awful lot like character growth.</p>
            <p>How do you do a character growth?</p>

            <section id="how-to-do-a-character-growth" class="level3">
            <h3>How to do a character growth</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>What does the character want?</li>
            <li>What do they actually need?</li>
            <li>Do they figure out what they need?</li>
            <li>What happens if they don’t?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is also called a character arc.</p>
            <p>Always remember: this isn’t about heists, it’s not about
            street races, and it sure as shit isn’t about cars. These
            are only ever analogies for what is really important.</p>

            <h2>Character Creation</h2>
            <p>You can be an undercover cop, a street racer, really
            whatever you want, it doesn’t matter. What matters is cars
            and family.</p>

            <h3>Cars and Family</h3>

            <section id="cars-and-family-1" class="level3">
            <h3><del>Cars and</del> Family</h3>
            <p>Your character either starts out with a family or they
            don’t.</p>
            <p>If you’re starting out with a family the sequence that
            introduces your character should be with your family and you
            should be having dinner together or hanging out being a
            family.</p>
            <p>If you don’t start out with a family your starting
            sequence can be whatever.</p>
            <p>Either way, come up with some dramatic tension for your
            character or pick one from the list below. This is what your
            character wants and should be incorporated into the starting
            sequence.</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>They want money.</li>
            <li>They’re trying to escape the law.</li>
            <li>They want to win a race.</li>
            <li>They’re trying to get out of crippling debt.</li>
            <li>They want a friend.</li>
            <li>They want to get out of jail.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Your character doesn’t realize it, but what do they
            actually need?</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>To let go of the past.</li>
            <li>To care about someone other than themselves.</li>
            <li>That it’s not about the destination, it’s about the
            journey.</li>
            <li>!?</li>

            <h2>Starting Sequence</h2>
            <p>Come up with a sequence that introduces your
            character.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Bonus points if you introduce multiple characters in the
            same sequence.</li>
            <li>What do you spend points on? Doesn’t matter.</li>
            <li>You know what matters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this sequence we get to find out what your character
            wants and that want is what drives the game forward. Your
            character is having a hard time getting what they want,
            which creates conflict. Conflict creates tension which
            eventually has a resolution, but may create more
            conflict.</p>

            <h2>Next Sequences</h2>
            <p>Telegraph the next sequence. If you dangled a cause in a
            previous sequence then let’s see the effect. However, you
            could leave it and drag it out a bit longer. If you just
            started playing the game then there should be more conflicts
            created than resolved and the conflicts you do resolve
            should cause other conflicts to arise. The opposite is true
            if you’re wanting your game to start coming to a close.</p>

            class="level2">
            <h2>Where does this highway lead to?</h2>
            <p>Eventually your conflicts will be resolved and your
            character’s arc will come to a close. Did they get what they
            wanted? Did they learn what they actually needed? If you’re
            doing a one-shot then great, but if you’re wanting to do
            multiple sessions you can have your characters arc last
            through multiple sessions or resolve and come up with new
            wants and needs or those wants and needs can change
            throughout the course of playing.</p>
            <p>And that’s how you play a fast and furious game of
            tabletop roleplaying.</p>
