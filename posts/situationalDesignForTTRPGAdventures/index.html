            <section>
            <p>This write up takes the lessons and tools from
            “Situational Design” by Brian Upton and explores how you
            might use them to create a simple ttrpg adventure. I highly
            recommend reading the book. It’s one of the most influential
            books on design that I’ve read in the last couple years.</p>
            <p>The basic methodology is:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Start with an <strong>experience</strong> you want the
            player to have.</li>
            <li>Identify <strong>moves</strong> or actions that express
            that experience.</li>
            <li>Figure out playful <strong>situations</strong> that will
            structure those moves.</li>
            <li>Determine the <strong>constraints</strong> we need to
            create those situations.</li>
            <li>Design a <strong>subsystem</strong> that will evoke
            those constraints.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Since this is a blog post it will be simplified for the
            sake of brevity. Let’s take some of the concepts from the
            book and see how we might use them to make an adventure.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="whats-the-experience" class="level2">
            <h2>What’s the experience?</h2>
            <p>Brief description of the type of experience you’re
            creating. Touchstones, theme, genre, tone, etc. Everything
            should relate back to the experience you want. This is our
            guiding light.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Adventurers in a classic dungeon delve</li>
            <li>Highschoolers in a horror mystery</li>
            <li>Detectives in a pulp noir</li>
            </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="what-are-the-players-moves" class="level2">
            <h2>What are the players moves?</h2>
            <p>Moves are what the player can do in the game that evoke
            that experience. The goal of this step is to build up a
            specific sense of what it means moment to moment for the
            player to inhabit their intended role within the game.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Loot a corpse</li>
            <li>Shine a flashlight down a dark hallway</li>
            <li>Knock out a thug in an alley</li>
            </ul>
            </section>
            <section
            id="what-types-of-situations-help-structure-those-moves"
            class="level2">
            <h2>What types of situations help structure those
            moves?</h2>
            <p>For the player to do these moves, they need to be in a
            situation that allows them to. This step is pretty straight
            forward. If your game is about exploration then the players
            need to be put into situations that allow them to explore.
            When designing situations always look for opportunities to
            incorporate choice, consequence, variety, and
            predictability.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>A monster eating a corpse, it started at you.</li>
            <li>A dark hallway with sounds of scurrying, you hear
            something behind you</li>
            <li>A thug in an alley, he’s dragging a body behind a
            dumpster.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Wait, what’s this about choice, consequence, variety, and
            predictability? These are our Pillars of Playfulness.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>We need choices, not too many and not too few.</li>
            <li>Choices need consequences.</li>
            <li>Variety in choices, consequences, situations, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Predictability? Isn’t that bad? Choices you make should
            have some level of predictability. Not necessarily complete
            predictability, and in fact that’s usually quite boring, but
            you want some predictability. If you drop a rock it falls to
            the ground.</p>
            <p>If you don’t have predictability there’s no choice
            because you don’t know what the consequences of those
            choices are. If you have a choice between going left or
            right and the paths are identical then that’s not really a
            choice. If down one path we smell fresh baked bread and down
            another we hear people talking, well now it’s a choice and
            there’s some level of predictability in the consequences of
            your actions.</p>
            </section>
            <section
            id="what-constraints-do-we-need-to-create-those-situations"
            class="level2">
            <h2>What constraints do we need to create those
            situations?</h2>
            <p>Constraints are interesting because they are both the
            rules of the game and the rules we create in our heads. If
            I’m playing a wizard there may be rules that constrain how
            wizards work in the game, but also I may have rules I’ve
            created in my mind on how I would role play my wizard
            character. The rules may say how to use magic, but I might
            choose to have my wizard only use fire magic.</p>
            <p>Situations are structured by constraints and determine
            what moves the player can do. We limit ourselves to the
            moves we believe are possible.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>What the player knows about vampires</li>
            <li>what the game tells us about vampires</li>
            <li>Rules in the game for how vampires work</li>
            </ul>
            </section>
            <section
            id="how-can-we-create-a-subsystem-that-evokes-those-constraints"
            class="level2">
            <h2>How can we create a subsystem that evokes those
            constraints?</h2>
            <p>This is finally where you create a subsystem that has
            constraints that create situations where the players perform
            the moves that embody the experience. Since this post is
            about ttrpg adventure design, this is often:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Locations</li>
            <li>Characters</li>
            <li>Creatures</li>
            <li>Items/Treasure</li>
            <li>Random Encounters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It could also be rules, procedures, maps, etc. As long as
            it’s helping create those constraints.</p>
            <p>Also keep in mind the constraints the player brings with
            them from their previous experiences. This gets into who you
            are designing for and what they know. Play tests are a great
            way to check your work and see if your design is working as
            intended. You might accidentally design with yourself in
            mind and likely you know things that the players do not.
            This can create confusion and the experience may not be what
            you were intending.</p>

            <section id="the-adventure" class="level2">
            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <p>Let’s see what this might look like in creating an
            adventure. First, what’s the experience?</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Highschool</li>
            <li>Horror</li>
            <li>Mystery</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Next let’s make some possible moves, keeping in mind the
            experience we’re trying to create:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Attending a highschool dance.</li>
            <li>Searching for a missing friend.</li>
            <li>Tracking a monster.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What situations would allow the players to perform these
            moves?</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The players are roleplaying as highschoolers and there’s
            a dance at their highschool.</li>
            <li>Another kid is freaking out and desperately asks the
            players to help find their missing friend.</li>
            <li>The players come across claw marks in walls, a shoe,
            bloody marks, or even footprints.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do these situations hold up to our Pillars of
            Playfulness?</p>
            <p>Theres a choice to go to the dance or not, but it doesn’t
            seem like there’s any consequences. Maybe you have a date
            and if you don’t go then you’d be standing them up. What
            about variety? Currently I don’t think there’s much for
            variety. It’s mostly one choice, maybe one or two
            consequences. What if we have our second situation: the
            missing friend, happen at the same time? Then the choices
            and consequences are much more interesting. Going back to
            variety, we can also try not to repeat the same situations
            too much. Maybe we don’t constantly have dances happening
            and people going missing.</p>
            <p>Finally, there’s predictability. You can probably guess
            what will happen if we go to the dance or not. What will
            happen to the missing friend if you don’t help though is a
            bit ambiguous. If the friend shows us the missing persons
            shoe and it has some blood on it though, then you have a
            pretty good idea of what will happen if you don’t find them.
            This becomes tricky though if the player suddenly thinks the
            missing person is way more interesting then the choice
            between that and the dance is diminished. Potentially it
            could not become a choice at all, which is the tricky part I
            think.</p>
            <p>Finally, what subsystem(s) will create the constraints
            needed for these situations?</p>
            <p>Starting the adventure off with the previously mentioned
            dance and missing friend situation seems to make sense and
            jumps us right into the experience we’re going for. We could
            also create some countdown timers to track the monster and
            other events in the game.</p>
            <p>Let’s create some lists! I’m trying to tie these to
            highschool, horror, and mystery. I’m thinking about what the
            players would be doing and what situations they might find
            themselves in. These all should help express that
            experience.</p>

            <p>I think I’m going to end this post here. It’s not a

            Again, I highly recommend the book and maybe this post will
            help give you some ideas. (I think I need to work on how to
            end these posts, this one’s a little abrupt)</p>
