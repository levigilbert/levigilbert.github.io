# Sequence Play

## Introduction

Sequence play was discussed in my previous post. I believe the concept has some possibility, but how it is currently isn't very actionable. This post is an attempt at taking that idea and making it playable.

## Goals for Sequence Play

- Character growth built into play.
- Low prep; sequences set up future sequences.
-  Procedures that can be standalone or incorporated with other games.

## Character Creation

When creating your character give them something they want badly, but are having difficulty getting. You can think of this as them chasing something or escaping something. You are giving your character motivation and by making it difficult to achieve you're creating conflict.

Come up with something they need, but don't realize they need it. This is what gives your character the possibility to grow and creates drama. Will they or won't they? Through the course of play you'll find out.

Wants and needs aren't set in stone. They can and should change during play.

Here are some suggestions to help you come up with wants and needs. You can also come up with your own lists of verbs, adjectives, and nouns to create a different tone for your game.

### Wants

1. To (verb) the (adjective) (noun).
2. To escape the (adjective) (noun) and (verb).
3. To become (adjective) by (verb)ing the (noun).
4. To stop being (adjective) and (verb) the (noun).
5. To be the (adjective) (noun) and (verb).
6. To not (verb) the (adjective) (noun).

### Nouns

1. Weapon
2. Flower
3. Tower
4. Creature
5. Land
6. Death

### Verbs

1. Forget
2. Remember
3. Find
4. Destroy
5. Taste
6. Create

### Adjectives

1. Dark
2. Corrupt
3. Beautiful
4. Ancient
5. Lost
6. Horrific

### Needs

1. to trust others.
2. to have friends.
3. to love.
4. to forgive.
5. to let go of the past.
6. to share a burden.

Write these down somewhere that you'll constantly see and be reminded. Wants and needs are your guiding light whenever you're making choices, figuring out what to do, and roleplaying. It's who your character is; more than their stats, more than their class, more than their items.

## Sequence Creation

- Did a character telegraph what might happen in the next sequence?[^1]
- Is there a cause that we haven't seen the effect of yet?[^2]
- What do the characters want and why are they having a hard time getting it?[^3]

[^1]: Telegraphing
[^2]: Dangling Cause or Cause and Effect
[^3]: Dramatic Tension

Sequences let you explore characters. When creating a sequence always think about the character's wants and needs.

If the word "sequences" is confusing, think of them as scenes, scenarios, or situations. The important thing is that a sequence has conflict, tension, and resolution. Each sequence is built around conflict, tension, and resolution. If there are future sequences then that resolution often creates even more conflict.

## Gameplay Loop

- Choices made in each sequence set up future sequences.
- Consequences of the choices you make create new sequences.

Earlier in the game you want to create more conflict than resolution. As the game progresses less conflict and more resolution bring the game to an end.

## Takeaways

Character-focused design seems to be the biggest advantage to this approach since so much of what you're creating is related to the characters, their wants and needs, and the choices they make. This potentially could have lower prep for games since sequence design is mostly established by the characters, but need to play test to find out.
