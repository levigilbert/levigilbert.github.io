# Sequence Play

## Introduction

Sequence play was discussed in my previous post. I believe the concept has some possibility, but how it is currently isn't very actionable. This post is an attempt at taking that idea and making it playable.

## Goals for Sequence Play

- Character growth built into play.
- Low prep; sequences set up future sequences.
-  Procedures that can be standalone or incorporated with other games.

## Character Creation

When you create your character give them something they want. You can think of this as them chasing something or escaping something. Either way they must have difficulty doing so. You are giving your character motivation and creating conflict.

Also come up with something they need, but don't realize. This is what gives your character the possibility to grow and created drama. Will they or won't they? And by playing you'll find out.

Write these down somewhere that you'll constantly see and be reminded. Your guiding light whenever you're making choices, whenever you're figuring out what to do, whenever you're roleplaying. These are who your character is; more than their stats, more than their class, more than their items.

## Sequence Creation

When creating a sequence always think about the character's wants and needs. Sequences let the players explore their characters.

If the word "sequences" is confusing, think of them as scenes, scenarios, or situations. The important thing is that a sequence has conflict, tension, and resolution.

Each sequence is built around conflict, tension, and resolution. If there are future sequences then that resolution often creates even more conflict.

- Did the players telegraph what might happen in the next sequence?[^1]
- Is there a cause that we haven't seen the effect of yet?[^2]
- What do the characters want and why are they having a hard time getting it?[^3]

[^1]: Telegraphing
[^2]: Dangling Cause or Cause and Effect
[^3]: Dramatic Tension

## Gameplay Loop

- Choices made in each sequence set up future sequences.
- Consequences of the choices you make create new sequences.

Earlier in the game you want to create more conflict than resolution. As the game progresses less conflict and more resolution bring the game to an end.

## Takeaways

Character-focused design seems to be the biggest advantage to this approach since so much of what you're creating is related to the characters, their wants and needs, and the choices they make. This potentially could have lower prep for games since sequence design is mostly established by the characters. My only concern with this approach is that it can keep very much into the story game realm and may not feel like a more typical ttrpg.
