# Sequence Play

## Introduction

Sequence play was discussed in my previous post. I believe the concept has some possibility, but how it is currently isn't very actionable. This post is an attempt at taking that idea and making something playable.

## Goals for Sequence Play

- Character growth built into play.
- Low prep; sequences set up future sequences.
-  Procedures that can be standalone or incorporated with other games.

## Character Creation

Give your character something they want badly, but are having difficulty getting. They are chasing or escaping something. You are giving your character motivation and by making it difficult to achieve you're creating conflict.

Give your character something they need, but don't realize they need it. Your character's arc is the contrast between their want and their need and how the relationship between the two plays out through the game. Wants and needs aren't set in stone. They can and should change during play as your character changes. 

Here are some suggestions to help you come up with wants and needs. You can also come up with your own lists of verbs, adjectives, and nouns to create a different tone for your game.

### Wants

1. To (verb) the (adjective) (noun).
2. To escape the (adjective) (noun) and (verb).
3. To become (adjective) by (verb)ing the (noun).
4. To stop being (adjective) and (verb) the (noun).
5. To be the (adjective) (noun) and (verb).
6. To not (verb) the (adjective) (noun).

### Nouns

1. Weapon
2. Flower
3. Tower
4. Creature
5. Land
6. Death

### Verbs

1. Forget
2. Remember
3. Find
4. Destroy
5. Taste
6. Create

### Adjectives

1. Dark
2. Corrupt
3. Beautiful
4. Ancient
5. Lost
6. Horrific

### Needs

1. to trust others.
2. to have friends.
3. to love.
4. to forgive.
5. to let go of the past.
6. to share a burden.

Write these down where you'll constantly see them and be reminded. Wants and needs are your guiding light whenever you're making choices, figuring out what to do, and roleplaying. It's who your character is; more than their stats, more than their class, more than their items.

## Sequence Creation

Sequences let you explore characters. Think about character's wants and needs. Build sequences around conflict, tension, and resolution.

- What do the characters want and why are they having a hard time getting it?[^1]
- Is there a cause that we haven't seen the effect of yet?[^2]
- Did a character telegraph what might happen in the next sequence?[^3]


[^1]: Dramatic Tension
[^2]: Dangling Cause or Cause and Effect
[^3]: Telegraphing

## Gameplay

- Choices made in each sequence telegraph future sequences.
- Consequences of the choices you make create new sequences.

### What you can do

- Make it more difficult to get what you want.
- Get what you want if it's been difficult.
- Want something else.
- Let go of your want and become conscious of what you need if you've suffered sufficiently.
- Do something that contrasts your want and your need.
- Telegraph what happens next.

### What a sequence can do

- Make it more difficult.
- Offer a choice.
- Reveal the effect of a choice.
- Contrast a character's wants and needs.

## Examples

I'm going to write up a few examples of what this might look like if you're only using sequence play.

### Solo

**Name**: Clarence

**Want**: To stop being dark and find the Death.

**Need**: To have friends.

I'm imagining Clarence has been stuck up in a tower too long and has a weird fascination with Death, but actually he just needs some friends.

**Starting Sequence**: Clarence is up in his tower frantically going through stacks of books and scribbling notes on scrolls. In a shout of delight he yells "Finally, I've found you!", and unravels a map onto the table.

Death would either be where lots of people are dieing or on holiday.

"Looks like they're at the Red Coast? I thought that was a vacation destination? Maybe it's common for folks to die on vacation?" Clarence starts stuffing scrolls into a backpack, "No matter, we're off to the beach."

The next sequence would probably be the beach. Clarence should have difficulty in getting what he wants so I'm guessing Death has left by the time he gets there. This would also be a good chance to potentially make friends, but I'm guessing at this time he has no interest in that.

## Takeaways

Character-focused design seems to be the biggest advantage to this approach since so much of what you're creating is related to the characters, their wants and needs, and the choices they make. This potentially could have lower prep for games since sequence design is mostly established by the characters, but need to play test to find out.
