                leveling procedures in ttrpgs</p>

            <section>
            <p>I haven’t written a post in a while and folks on Discord
            were talking about leveling up. Typically in ttrpgs you gain
            experience points from playing the game and then at a
            certain point, sometimes after every session, you can spend
            those points and level up your character. This usually
            grants your character some extra HP, stat increases, and new
            abilities.</p>
            <p>For this design exercise I’m going to try to:</p>
            <section id="remove" class="level3">
            <h3>Remove</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Numbers/tracking XP</li>
            <li>Stat increases</li>
            <li>New abilities</li>
            </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="keep" class="level3">
            <h3>Keep</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Closure</li>
            <li>Sense of achievement</li>
            <li>Break in the action</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I’m not as interested in the mechanical side of leveling
            up. I think there’s been some good discussion on diegetic
            advancement, having your characters change, etc. I’m more
            interested in that feeling of leveling up at the end of a
            session and try to capture that in a different way by having
            the players make camp and change the pace of the game at the
            end of a session.</p>
            </section>
            </section>
            <section id="make-a-campfire" class="level2">
            <h2>Make a Campfire</h2>
            <p>If the session is winding down, 15 minutes left, try
            making a campfire.</p>
            <p>Roll a d6:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>A small fire that flickers out half-way through the
            night. You will get little rest.</li>
            <li>It is an ok fire.</li>
            <li>A perfectly fine fire.</li>
            <li>A good fire. You will feel better in the morning.</li>
            <li>One might worry about waking up on fire.</li>
            <li>A very large and bright fire. Maybe a bit too
            visible.</li>
            </ol>
            </section>
            <section id="tell-stories-by-the-fire" class="level2">
            <h2>Tell Stories by the Fire</h2>
            <p>Each player takes turns discussing:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>What your favorite part of the session was.</li>
            <li>If your character has changed (mentally, physically,
            beliefs, etc).</li>
            <li>What you hope for in the days to come.</li>
            </ol>
            </section>
            <section id="sleep-and-dream" class="level2">
            <h2>Sleep and Dream</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of the next session each player rolls a
            d6. Tell them what they dream:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Portents.</li>
            <li>Clues.</li>
            <li>Strange and confusing.</li>
            <li>Something from the past.</li>
            <li>Nightmares.</li>
            <li>You can’t remember.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Weave these into the fiction. If you need a spark of
            inspiration, use the following tables:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Crows</li>
            <li>Crowns</li>
            <li>Death</li>
            <li>Blood</li>
            <li>Bones</li>
            <li>Darkness</li>
            </ol>
            <hr />
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Treasure</li>
            <li>Snake</li>
            <li>Sword</li>
            <li>Poison</li>
            <li>Heart</li>
            <li>Sun</li>
            </ol>
            <hr />
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Wind</li>
            <li>Family</li>
            <li>Chains</li>
            <li>Bridge</li>
            <li>Peace</li>
            <li>War</li>
            </ol>
            </section>
            <section id="final-thoughts" class="level2">
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>The intent is to allow for players to reflect on the
            session and allow for feedback. Also allowing for some
            potential direction the players may be interested in that
            the GM doesn’t know about. This change of pace allows for a
            break in the action and to keep things fresh.</p>
